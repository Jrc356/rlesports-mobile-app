# Rocket League eSports Mobile App
A flutter mobile app for Rocket League eSports. The idea of this was to be able to see live scores without having to 
load up the live stream via twitch or youtube. I also wanted to be able to follow specific teams and/or players and 
tailor a news feed to be more relevant to me.

# Development
## Quick Start
It is recommended to use the flutter vscode plugin to launch an emulator and run. Open the `rlesports_app` dir in vscode 
and hit `F5`. This should start an emulator, compile the code, and run the app.

# Planned features
See the [features](./docs/features.md) doc on the ideas and implementation plans I had when starting the app. The most 
important feature of this is the live scores viewing.
