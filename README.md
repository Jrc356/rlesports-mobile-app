# rlesports-mobile-app
A flutter mobile app for rocket league esports. The idea of this was to be able 
to see live scores without having to load up the live stream via twitch or 
youtube. I also wanted to be able to follow specific teams and/or players and 
tailor a news to be more relevant to me.

# Planned features
See the [features](./docs/features.md) doc on the ideas and implemenation plans 
I had when starting the app. The most important feature for this is the 
live scores.

# Design
See the [pages.drawio](./docs/pages.drawio) file in the docs dir for a 
[draw.io](draw.io) diagram of the original design. It morphed a little over time
in development without fully updating the drawio file.
